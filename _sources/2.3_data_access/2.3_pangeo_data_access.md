# Access EO Data from the Cloud with Pangeo

Using a cloud provider for accessing data, and in this specific scenario Earth Observation data, could improve your productivity a lot. To get the most out of it, we will provide you some important insights.

### Learning objectives

- In this lecture you will learn the usage and peculiarities of the main data operators commonly available on cloud platforms like:
  - Data loading
  - Filter
  - Apply
  - Reduce
  - Resample
  - Aggregate
- Finally, you will be able to create a simple workflow with openEO.

The exercise will use the Pangeo ecosystem.
